I am a full stack developer at Tata Consultancy Services with 1+ year experience. My expertise include Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, RESTful web services and Angular 5. I am a computer science graduate(2017) from Asansol Engineering College, West Bengal.

I've always been passionate about computers. Earlier in my childhood, this passion was more about computer gaming but with passage of time, it started taking proper shape and it has now become a grown up passion for coding and learning how things work (can't negotiate gaming part also).

I am a great learner and self-learning enthusiast who can work upto his limits and even push them. Basically, I am open to all platforms related to software and development fields so as to increase my learning curve. I have worked on some side projects apart from my day job, which can be found the under projects section on this page and also on my github profile.
