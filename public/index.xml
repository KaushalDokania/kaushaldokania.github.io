      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/▾ images/logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/▾ static/▾ images/logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>What are Go Packages? Modularity and code reusability are among the essential pillars of good software engineering practices. Functions are the first layer of code reusability in any programming language. Go takes it to another level by providing a different mechanism: packages.
According to the official Go documentation: How to write Go code
 Go programs are organized into packages. A package is a collection of source files in the same directory that are compiled together.</description>

      <description>We spend a lot of time on Linux bash shell either using Git, writing/running scripts, building/serving applications or analyzing server logs. That&amp;rsquo;s why we need a bash prompt which gives us important information and is also easy to read. To improve the look and feel even further you can also add colors to your PS1 prompt.
What is PS1? PS1(Prompt String 1) is one of the shell prompts available in Linux/Unix.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>
